# WallBudget
This is a Desktop Budget Application (early version) that uses MySQL.  It (as an early version) used a different database for each month.  Newer version (See Malachi Budget) uses one database and is expanded to allow multiple users and includes a login feature.  This was mostly for personal use and learning.
